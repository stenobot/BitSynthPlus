# BitSynthPlus
In 2012, I built a free 8-bit synthesizer called BitSynth for the Windows Phone 7 platform. It has over 80k downloads, and enjoys a 4.3 star rating in the Store.

This is a ground-up rebuild of the app for Univeral Windows devices. it is available now and free to download at the Windows Store. Enjoy!
